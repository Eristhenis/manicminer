b 23552 Attribute buffer (cavern + Willy + guardians + items)
D 23552 The routine at #R34574 initialises this buffer with the contents of the attribute buffer at #R24064 (empty cavern), writes the attributes for Willy, the guardians and the items into it, and then copies the result to the attribute file.

D 32956 Initialised (always to 63 in practice) and used by the routine at #R34436, updated by the routine at #R35388, and also used by the routine at #R36904. Its value ranges from 36 to 63 and is actually the LSB of the display file address for the cell at the right end of the air bar. The amount of air to draw in this cell is determined by the value of the game clock at #R32957.
g 32957 Game clock
; @label:32957=CLOCK
D 32957 Initialised by the routine at #R34436, updated on every pass through the main loop by the routine at #R35388, and used for timing purposes by the routines at #R36111, #R36344 and #R37173. Its value (which is always a multiple of 4) is also used by the routine at #R35388 to compute the amount of air to draw in the cell at the right end of the air bar.
g 32958 Horizontal guardians
; @label:32958=HGUARDS
D 32958 The horizontal guardian definitions are copied here by the routine at #R34436, and then used by the routines at #R36111 and #R36266. There are four slots, each one seven bytes long, used to hold the state of the horizontal guardians in the current cavern.
D 32958 For each horizontal guardian, the seven bytes are used as follows:
D 32958 #TABLE(default,centre,:w) {{ =h Byte | =h Contents }} {{ =r2 0 | Bit 7: animation speed (0=normal, 1=slow) }} {{ Bits 0-6: attribute (BRIGHT, PAPER and INK) }} {{ 1,2 | Address of the guardian's location in the attribute buffer at #R23552 }} {{ 3 | MSB of the address of the guardian's location in the screen buffer at #R24576 }} {{ 4 | Animation frame }} {{ 5 | LSB of the address of the leftmost point of the guardian's path in the attribute buffer }} {{ 6 | LSB of the address of the rightmost point of the guardian's path in the attribute buffer }} TABLE#

B 32986 Terminator (set to 255)
g 32987 Eugene's direction or the Kong Beast's status
; @label:32987=EUGDIR
D 32987 Initialised by the routine at #R34436, and used by the routines at #R36344 (to hold Eugene's direction: 0=down, 1=up) and #R37173 (to hold the Kong Beast's status: 0=on the ledge, 1=falling, 2=dead).
g 32988 Eugene's or the Kong Beast's pixel y-coordinate
; @label:32988=EUGHGT
D 32988 Initialised by the routine at #R34436, and used by the routines at #R34252 (to hold the index into the message scrolled across the screen after the theme tune has finished playing), #R35140 (to hold the distance of the boot from the top of the screen as it descends onto Willy), #R36344 (to hold Eugene's pixel y-coordinate) and #R37173 (to hold the Kong Beast's pixel y-coordinate).
g 32989 Vertical guardians
; @label:32989=VGUARDS
D 32989 The vertical guardian definitions are copied here by the routine at #R34436, and then used by the routines at #R36469 and #R36593. There are four slots, each one seven bytes long, used to hold the state of the vertical guardians in the current cavern.
D 32989 For each vertical guardian, the seven bytes are used as follows:
D 32989 #TABLE(default,centre,:w) {{ =h Byte | =h Contents }} {{ 0 | Attribute }} {{ 1 | Animation frame }} {{ 2 | Pixel y-coordinate }} {{ 3 | x-coordinate }} {{ 4 | Pixel y-coordinate increment }} {{ 5 | Minimum pixel y-coordinate }} {{ 6 | Maximum pixel y-coordinate }} TABLE#
D 32989 In most of the caverns that do not have vertical guardians, this area is overwritten by unused bytes from the cavern definition. The exception is #R49152(Eugene's Lair): the routine at #R34436 copies the graphic data for the Eugene sprite into the last 32 bytes of this area, where it is then used by the routine at #R36344.

D 33799 Initialised by the routine at #R34252, used by the routines at #R34436, #R34574, #R35445 and #R36266, and updated by the routine at #R36904.
b 33800 Left-right movement table
; @label:33800=LRMOVEMENT
D 33800 Used by the routine at #R35805. The entries in this table are used to map the existing value (V) of Willy's direction and movement flags at #R32874 to a new value (V'), depending on the direction Willy is facing and how he is moving or being moved (by 'left' and 'right' keypresses and joystick input, or by a conveyor).
D 33800 One of the first four entries is used when Willy is not moving.
  33800 V=0 (facing right, no movement) + no movement: V'=0 (no change)
  33801 V=1 (facing left, no movement) + no movement: V'=1 (no change)
  33802 V=2 (facing right, moving) + no movement: V'=0 (facing right, no movement) (i.e. stop)
  33803 V=3 (facing left, moving) + no movement: V'=1 (facing left, no movement) (i.e. stop)
D 33804 One of the next four entries is used when Willy is moving left.
  33804 V=0 (facing right, no movement) + move left: V'=1 (facing left, no movement) (i.e. turn around)
  33805 V=1 (facing left, no movement) + move left: V'=3 (facing left, moving)
  33806 V=2 (facing right, moving) + move left: V'=1 (facing left, no movement) (i.e. turn around)
  33807 V=3 (facing left, moving) + move left: V'=3 (no change)
D 33808 One of the next four entries is used when Willy is moving right.
  33808 V=0 (facing right, no movement) + move right: V'=2 (facing right, moving)
  33809 V=1 (facing left, no movement) + move right: V'=0 (facing right, no movement) (i.e. turn around)
  33810 V=2 (facing right, moving) + move right: V'=2 (no change)
  33811 V=3 (facing left, moving) + move right: V'=0 (facing right, no movement) (i.e. turn around)
D 33812 One of the final four entries is used when Willy is being pulled both left and right; each entry leaves the flags at #R32874 unchanged (so Willy carries on moving in the direction he's already moving, or remains stationary).
  33812 V=V'=0 (facing right, no movement)
  33813 V=V'=1 (facing left, no movement)
  33814 V=V'=2 (facing right, moving)
  33815 V=V'=3 (facing left, moving)
