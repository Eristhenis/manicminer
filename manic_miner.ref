This disassembly would have taken a lot longer to finish if it weren't for the research and documentation already done and made available by Andrew Broad. In particular, his comprehensive documentation on the <a class="link" href="http://webspace.webring.com/people/ja/andrewbroad/mm_format.html">Manic Miner room format</a>, which describes most of the important data structures used in the game, was of great help.
</div>

[Glossary:Guardian]
An inhabitant of a cavern that continuously moves left and right (horizontal guardian) or up and down (vertical guardian) in a straight line. Contact with a guardian is fatal.

[Glossary:Nasty]
An immobile object drawn in a single cell as part of a cavern along with the background, walls, floors and conveyor. Contact with a nasty is fatal. Some examples are:

#UDGTABLE(gallery)
{ #R47104(The Menagerie)       | #UDG47703,67(nasty2_2) }
{ #R51200(The Vat)             | #UDG51799,22(nasty2_6) }
{ #R54272(The Endorian Forest) | #UDG54871,4(nasty2_9) }
TABLE#

[Fact:takingABreak:Taking a BREAK]
The game quits if BREAK - that is, CAPS SHIFT and SPACE - is pressed (see #R34801).

[Fact:6031769:6031769]
If you type the digits 6031769 at any point during the game, a cheat mode is activated that enables Willy to teleport to any cavern; a boot appears next to Willy's remaining lives to show that the cheat mode has been activated.

For example, to teleport to #R51200(The Vat), hold down keys '2' and '3', and then press '6' to activate the teleporter. For a list of all the caverns and their teleport codes, see the #LINK:Caverns(Caverns page).

The number 6031769 comes from Matthew Smith's driving licence, "with an error in it and twisted round a bit" (as he put it in an interview for issue 48 of <i>Retro Gamer</i> magazine).

[Fact:unusedCrumblingFloor:Unused crumbling floor]
The crumbling floor tile in #R58368(Skylab Landing Bay) is unique to that cavern, and also not used.

#UDGTABLE { #UDG58931,2(crumbling_floor_13) } TABLE#

To place a couple of these tiles in the cavern in order to see them crumble:

POKE 58811,10: POKE 58812,10: POKE 58930,10

[Fact:itemGraphics:Item graphics]
The commonest item graphic is the key, which appears in #R45056(Central Cavern), #R47104(The Menagerie), #R48128(Abandoned Uranium Workings), #R50176(Processing Plant), #R51200(The Vat), #R53248(Wacky Amoebatrons), #R61440(The Warehouse), #R62464(Amoebatrons' Revenge), #R63488(Solar Power Generator) and #R64512(The Final Barrier).

#UDGTABLE { #UDG45748,3(item00) } TABLE#

Next is the banana, which appears in #R52224(Miner Willy meets the Kong Beast) and #R56320(Return of the Alien Kong Beast):

#UDGTABLE { #UDG52916,3(item07) } TABLE#

The other eight caverns have their own unique item graphics:

#UDGTABLE(gallery)
{ #R46080(The Cold Room)                   | #UDG46772,11(item01) }
{ #R49152(Eugene's Lair)                   | #UDG49844,19(item04) }
{ #R54272(The Endorian Forest)             | #UDG54964,3(item09) }
{ #R55296(Attack of the Mutant Telephones) | #UDG55988,3(item10) }
{ #R57344(Ore Refinery)                    | #UDG58036,3(item12) }
{ #R58368(Skylab Landing Bay)              | #UDG59060,11(item13) }
{ #R59392(The Bank)                        | #UDG60084,3(item14) }
{ #R60416(The Sixteenth Cavern)            | #UDG61108,3(item15) }
TABLE#

[Fact:itemCounts:Item counts]
Fourteen of the twenty caverns have a full set of five items.

#R52224(Miner Willy meets the Kong Beast) and #R60416(The Sixteenth Cavern) both have four items.

#R59392(The Bank) and #R63488(Solar Power Generator) both have three items.

There are no caverns that have exactly two items.

#R53248(Wacky Amoebatrons) and #R62464(Amoebatrons' Revenge) both have only one item.

[Fact:extraItems:Extra items]
#R59392(The Bank) has five items defined, but only three of them are used; #R60416(The Sixteenth Cavern) also has five items defined, but only four of them are used.

The two extra items in #R59392(The Bank) are at (6,19) and (13,30), shown here in bright white:

#PUSHS
#POKES60036,71;60041,71
#UDGTABLE { #CALL:cavern(59392,2,the_bank_extra_items) } TABLE#
#POPS

The extra item in #R60416(The Sixteenth Cavern) is at (5,26) - in the path of the cyan guardian - shown here in bright white:

#PUSHS
#POKES61065,71;61140,188
#UDGTABLE { #CALL:cavern(60416,2,the_sixteenth_cavern_extra_items) } TABLE#
#POPS

[Fact:guardianColours:Guardian colours]
The most common guardian colour is yellow (21 instances), and the least common colour is black (only one instance, in #R49152(Eugene's Lair)).

As for the other colours, there are 3 blue guardians, 10 red guardians, 12 magenta guardians, 13 green guardians, 14 cyan guardians, and 5 white guardians.

[Fact:guardianCounts:Guardian counts]
The cavern with the most guardians is #R62464(Amoebatrons' Revenge), which has eight (the maximum).

The cavern with the least guardians is #R45056(Central Cavern), which has only one.

[Fact:guardiansNeedAClearPath:Guardians need a clear path]
The guardian-drawing code kills Willy if a guardian collides with anything that's already been drawn in the room. This means, for example, that Willy is killed if a guardian hits a nasty, a wall or the floor.

See this happen by placing a wall block in the path of the guardian in #R45056(Central Cavern):

POKE 45327,22

[Fact:variableAirSupply:Variable air supply]
The initial air supply varies from cavern to cavern by small amounts, because of differences in the initial value of the game clock at #R32957 - 128, 240, 248 or 252 - which is copied from byte 701 of the cavern definition.

The caverns with the greatest initial air supply are #R45056(Central Cavern), #R46080(The Cold Room), #R57344(Ore Refinery), #R59392(The Bank) and #R64512(The Final Barrier), which initialise the game clock to 252.

Next are #R54272(The Endorian Forest), #R58368(Skylab Landing Bay) and #R60416(The Sixteenth Cavern), which initialise the game clock to 248.

Then it's #R63488(Solar Power Generator), which initialises the game clock to 240.

The other 11 caverns initialise the game clock to 128, which means the cell at the right end of the air bar in those caverns starts off with only three white pixel columns instead of seven.

[Fact:theUnreachableMillion:The unreachable million]
The score (at least, the part of it that is printed - see #R33829) rolls around to zero when it hits a million.

[Fact:sourceCodeRemnants:Source code remnants]
Before the game starts for the first time, the 512-byte cavern buffer at #LINK:GameStatusBuffer#32768(32768) contains source code remnants (shown below). The DB directives define part of the title screen tune data at #R33902. There are more source code remnants at #R37708.

TABLE#

[Bug:throughTheWall:Through the wall]
If Willy jumps left over the two nasties at the bottom right of #R49152(Eugene's Lair) such that he lands on the top layer of bricks with animation frame 0 at step 16 of the jumping animation, he will then fall through them to the bottom layer of bricks:

#UDGTABLE(gallery)
{ #CALL:wall_bug_img(1) | #CALL:wall_bug_img(2)  | #CALL:wall_bug_img(3) | #CALL:wall_bug_img(4) }
{ Step 15               | Step 16                | Step 17               | Step 18 }
TABLE#

This happens because the section of code at #R35600 - which is executed during jumping animation step 16, when Willy is exactly one cell height above the place he jumped from - checks whether there are any nasty tiles in the cells below Willy's sprite; if there are, the code jumps forward to #R35665, which makes Willy proceed to the next jumping animation step (as if the bricks and the nasty were not there), instead of landing on the bricks (and being killed by the nasty).

Perhaps the assumption in this code is that if there is a nasty tile below Willy's sprite in step 16, then he will be killed by the nasty in step 17; however, in this particular case Willy's x-coordinate decreases by one from step 16 to step 17, which moves him out of the nasty's range.

[Poke:gentleGuardians:Gentle guardians]
To enable Willy to walk through guardians with impunity:

POKE #R36860,0: POKE #R36872,0

[Poke:niceNasties:Nice nasties]
To enable Willy to survive contact with nasties:

POKE #R37488,201

[Poke:harmlessHeights:Harmless heights]
To enable Willy to survive a fall from any height:

POKE #R35808(35809),255

[Poke:noConveyors:No conveyors]
To enable Willy to walk freely in any direction on conveyors:

POKE #R35834,0

[Poke:cheatModeCheat:Cheat mode cheat]
To activate the #FACT#6031769(6031769 cheat mode) immediately (without having to type 6031769):

POKE #R33885,7

For a list of all the caverns and their teleport codes, see the #LINK:Caverns(Caverns page).

[Poke:alwaysOpen:Always open]
To enable Willy to walk through the portal to the next cavern without collecting all the items first:

POKE #R36825(36826),0

[Poke:noSkylabs:No Skylabs]
To remove the Skylabs from #R58368(Skylab Landing Bay):

POKE #R36478,195

[Poke:likeableLightBeam:Likeable light beam]
To prevent the light beam in #R63488(Solar Power Generator) from decreasing the air supply:

POKE #R36230,24

[Poke:moreLives:More lives]
To start the game with N lives remaining (0&lt;=N&lt;=255; normally N=2):

POKE #R34268(34269),N

Note that the routine at #R34574 tries to draw all remaining lives at the bottom of the screen, which means that for large N, there is screen corruption and the game slows down considerably; to avoid this, disable the drawing of more than one remaining life:

POKE #R34606(34607),0

[Poke:infiniteLives:Infinite lives]
To give Willy infinite lives:

POKE #R35136,0
